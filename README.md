# 🌱 CropMate AI  

## Overview  
Agriculture has long been the backbone of economies around the world, especially in a country like India where a significant portion of the population relies on farming for their livelihood. One of the most critical decisions farmers face is **determining the right time to harvest crops**.  

Factors such as **climatic conditions, soil health, and market dynamics** greatly influence these decisions. A delay in harvesting can lead to crop damage, reduced quality, and financial loss, while premature harvesting can cause immature produce and wastage.  

**CropMate AI** is a smart solution designed to solve this problem. It leverages modern technologies like **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Web Technologies** to help farmers make **data-driven decisions** about the optimal time to harvest their crops.
